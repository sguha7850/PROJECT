This issue may be related to a version conflict between system libraries and the libstdc++ version included with MATLAB. You may be able to resolve this issue by making MATLAB use your system's libstdc++ instead of the libstdc++ shipped with MATLAB. While you can accomplish this in the way described by Joseph above, there is a better way: From a Linux shell (with appropriate permissions to make modifications in your MATLAB installation, i.e. use "sudo" if needed or work with your system administrator):

1. cd into your MATLAB sys/os/glnxa64 directory.
2. Create a new directory named "old": mkdir old
3. Move libstdc++* into the old directory:
4. copy system libstdc++ file from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.25 and paste it in glnxa64 folder
